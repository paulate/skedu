## skedu
a mashup of schedule and todo, spelled incorrectly

![skedu](skedu-1.gif)

It's a day & hour planner / organizer. Type in your TODOs, drag and drop them to the timeslots. Helpful for final projects (except when you're spending time on building the tool). 

- Uses html5 local caching so your schedule is saved on your computer. 
- Drag & drop is html w/ javascript
- Lots of room for improvement
